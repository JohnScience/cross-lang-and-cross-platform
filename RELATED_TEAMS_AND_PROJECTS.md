# K Framework

> K is a rewrite-based executable semantic framework in which programming languages, type systems and formal analysis tools can be defined using configurations and rules. Configurations organize the state in units called cells, which are labeled and can be nested. K rewrite rules make it explicit which parts of the term are read-only, write-only, read-write, or unused. This makes K suitable for defining truly concurrent languages even in the presence of sharing. Computations are represented as syntactic extensions of the original language abstract syntax, using a nested list structure which sequentializes computational tasks, such as program fragments. Computations are like any other terms in a rewriting environment: they can be matched, moved from one place to another, modified, or deleted. This makes K suitable for defining control-intensive features such as abrupt termination, exceptions, or call/cc.

## Notes

* Their work can be useful to further extend the **scope** of our project and their expertise can help understand the **limitations** of our project.

* At the moment of writing, as far as the author understands, K framework allows to define the language itself but not its **implementations**, which is crucial for cross-language interoperability.

## Notes

* Interoperability with C++ is one of the main goals of Carbon language as its *potential* language-successor.

# Meetups

## International

* [LLVM / Clang network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/llvm/)

At the time of writing, the network consists of 13 groups in 10 countries.

# On interaction with other projects, teams, and individual developers

The process of interaction with other projects, teams, and developers is not yet established. Neither is the list of values for the process. However, there's an understanding that the process must be seamless and transparent.

# On connection of "Related projects, teams, and individual developers" to "Learning resources"
