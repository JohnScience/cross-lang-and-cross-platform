# History

From inception to active work.

## First ideas

Initially, the goal of the project was to combine [`LLVM-CBE`] with [`SWIG`] for the purpose of facilitation cross-language code reuse. [`SWIG`] is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages: (1) C# (Mono and MS .NET), (2) D, (3) Go, (4) Guile, (5) Java, (6) JavaScript (Node.js, V8, and WebKit), (7) Lua, (8) MzScheme/Racket, (9) OCaml, (10) Octave, (11) Perl, (12) PHP, (13) Python, (14) R, (15) Ruby, (16) Scilab, and (17) Tcl/Tk. For every of the earlier mentioned target languages, [`SWIG`] can generate wrappers around C libraries (that *were planned* to be generated by [`LLVM-CBE`]).

Unfortunately, [`LLVM-CBE`] was found to be unreasonably hard to build and borderline impossible to ship to the developers. The details of the original plans can be found in the repo of the halted [`llvm-cbe-sys`](https://github.com/JohnScience/llvm-cbe-sys/).

## Moving forward

Unfeasibility of shipping original [`LLVM-CBE`] led to skyrocketing of the required work necessary for creating the first proof of concept. Once this fact had been found, the team considered available options and decided to persevere and devise another plan.
