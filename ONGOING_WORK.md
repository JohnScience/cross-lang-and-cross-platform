# Ongoing work

## [LLVM-CBE] reimplementation

On wait while the working group gains expertise in [LLVM] by building [LLVM] parser.

## [LLVM] parser

On wait while the working group gains expertise in building parsers with [`pest`]. The development of [LLVM] parser is justified by the need of acquiring knowledge about [LLVM].

<!-- The need for LLVM experise must be supported with a link to the list of desired competencies -->

## Pattern for avoiding [E207] and alternative to Haskell's [ConstraintKinds][Kwang's Haskell Blog, "Comparing Traits and Typeclasses"] in Rust

* [Comparing Traits and Typeclasses]
* [Kwang's Haskell Blog, "Comparing Traits and Typeclasses"]

## Preparing for the call

The project needs lots of competencies and lots of developers to get the work done.

We need a list of influencers on different platforms who would be willing to announce our plans.
