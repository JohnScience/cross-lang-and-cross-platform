## [LLVM-CBE] reimplementation

On wait while the working group gains expertise in [LLVM] by building [LLVM] parser.

## [LLVM] parser

On wait while the working group gains expertise in building parsers with [`nom`] by building [`latex_parser`]. The development of [LLVM] parser is justified by the need of acquiring knowledge about [LLVM].

<!-- The need for LLVM experise must be supported with a link to the list of desired competencies -->

## LaTeX parser

On wait while the working group devises a systematic and well-explained approach for dealing with [E207] and an alternative to Haskell's [ConstraintKinds][Kwang's Haskell Blog, "Comparing Traits and Typeclasses"] in Rust.

## Pattern for avoiding [E207] and alternative to Haskell's [ConstraintKinds] in Rust
